# Spam Classifier using Apache Spark

---

## Executive Summary

This project aims to develop and deploy a real-time spam classification system using Apache Spark. The system is designed to process both batch and streaming data, enabling the classification of messages as either spam or ham. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Naive Bayes classifier, the system ensures accurate and efficient classification, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of communication channels.

## Business Problem

Spam messages pose a significant threat to communication systems, leading to decreased productivity, increased risk of phishing attacks, and overall reduced trust in digital communication. Traditional spam filters often struggle with real-time data processing, which can result in delayed detection and higher false-positive rates. This project addresses the need for a scalable, real-time solution that can efficiently classify incoming messages, thereby enhancing security and user experience.

## Methodology

The project is implemented using Apache Spark, a powerful tool for big data processing and machine learning. The process involves:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset containing messages labeled as spam or ham is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - Tokenization of messages into words.
   - Removal of stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
   - Creation of bigrams to capture word pairs.
   - Conversion of text into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
   - Label encoding of the target variable (Spam/Ham).
3. **Model Training**: A Naive Bayes classifier is trained using a pipeline that automates the preprocessing and model training steps.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) to assess its performance.
5. **Streaming Data Processing**: The system is set up to handle streaming data, where incoming messages are classified in real-time using the trained model.

## Skills

The project requires proficiency in the following skills:

- **Python Programming**: For implementing the Spark code and machine learning pipeline.
- **Apache Spark**: Expertise in Spark Streaming, Spark SQL, and Spark MLlib for handling large-scale data processing and machine learning.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, n-gram generation, and feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning**: Understanding of the Naive Bayes classifier and evaluation metrics like AUC.
- **Big Data Handling**: Managing and processing large datasets efficiently.

## Results

The trained Naive Bayes model achieves a high Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), indicating strong performance in distinguishing between spam and ham messages. The model is successfully deployed to classify messages in both batch and real-time scenarios, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in a production environment.

## Next Steps

To further enhance the system, the following steps can be considered:

1. **Model Optimization**: Experiment with other classification algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve accuracy.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features like message length, sender reputation, or sentiment analysis to enrich the model.
3. **Deployment in Production**: Integrate the classifier into a production environment, possibly with a user interface for monitoring and managing classifications.
4. **Handling Multilingual Data**: Extend the model to support spam classification in multiple languages.
5. **Continuous Learning**: Implement a system for continuous model training and updating based on new data to adapt to evolving spam tactics.
